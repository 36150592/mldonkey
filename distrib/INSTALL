USAGE:
======

The distribution contains 3 binaries:
  mlnet: the daemon containing support for all networks
  mlgui: the default GTK Graphical Interface
  mlnet+gui: the daemon bundled with the GTK interface

 To start, create an empty directory, where mlnet will store is
configuration file, go in that directory and start mlnet. By default, only
Edonkey, Overnet and BitTorrent are enabled. Other networks can be enabled by
setting the options.

You can then use 3 interfaces:

1) WEB: open http://127.0.0.1:4080/

2) Telnet: telnet 127.0.0.1 4000

3) The GUI: mlgui

Normally, you can use CTRL-C to stop it, even if the best way is still
to use the 'kill' INTERNAL command in one of the 3 interfaces.

To change options, stop mlnet, and then edit its configuration files:

downloads.ini : basic options (which networks to use, port,...)
donkey.ini: basic edonkey options
gnutella.ini: options for gnutella
  and so on...
..._expert.ini: these files contain options that should only be changed
   by expert users.

NETWORKS:
=========

eDonkey/Overnet (config files: donkey.ini and donkey_expert.ini)
   Enabled by default

BitTorrent (config file: bittorrent.ini)
   Enabled by default. No server or search possible. You need to get
   URLs of .torrent files from the WEB, and use 'dllink <URL>' to start
   a download. If the download does not appear after a few seconds, the
   WEB site was probably unreachable (use 'wget' then to get the file,
   and 'dllink <FILE>' to start the download).

Gnutella (config file: gnutella.ini)
   To enable, set 'enable_gnutella' to true in downloads.ini, and verify that
     'enable_gnutella1' is true in gnutella.ini

Gnutella2 (config file: gnutella.ini)
   To enable,set 'enable_gnutella' to true in downloads.ini, and verify that
     'enable_gnutella2' is true in gnutella.ini. You can also disable gnutella1
     by setting 'enable_gnutella1' to false in gnutella.ini

Soulseek (config file: soulseek.ini)
   
Opennap (config file: opennap.ini)

Direct-Connect (config file: directconnect.ini)
