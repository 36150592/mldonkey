<li> <h2> Background </H2>

<ol>
  <li> <h3> <a name=back1> What is mldonkey ? </a> </h3>

Formerly, mldonkey was a Linux client for the eDonkey network, built from
a reverse-engineered version of the protocol. Now, it is also able to connect
to multiple networks (gnutella, Direct-Connect, Soulseek, etc).

<p> 
MLdonkey runs on most Unix clones: Linux (x86, alpha, sparc), Mac OS X, 
Solaris x86, Free/OpenBSD, etc.

<p>

It runs as a daemon, in the background, that can run, downloading and sharing
files, 24 hours a day. You can interact with your mldonkey daemon, either
locally or remotely, by a telnet interface, a WEB interface or a GTK 
GUI. Other GUIs have also been created for mldonkey.

  <li> <h3> <a name=back2> Why use Objective-Caml to program mldonkey ?  </a> </h3>

Most programmers associate functional languages with languages theory,
lambda-calculus, recursivity, and non-mutable variables, ie the most 
boring lectures at university.

<p>
 Fortunately, Objective-Caml is not only a functional language: it also
provides many other programming paradigms, such as imperative constructs
(<tt>while</tt> and <tt>for</tt> loops, mutable variables, records),
object-oriented constructs, and a powerful C-interface. Moreover, its 
native-code compiler carefully checks your program for typing errors (no 
more segfaults !), and produces a very efficient code (even faster than C 
on many examples).

<p>
If you don't believe me, check the following links:
<ul>
<li>

<li> Two Objective Caml programs win first and second prizes at the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/"> ICFP'2000 programming contest </a>,

<li> An Objective Caml program ranks first at the
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jks6b/icfp/">  ICFP'1999 programming contest </a>.
</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=back3> Where can I find support on mldonkey ?  </a> </h3>

The first place is the 
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/mldonkey/"> MLdonkey Project Site</a>
 where you will find:

<ul>
  <li> The <a href="mailto:mldonkey-users@mail.freesoftware.fsf.org"> 
mldonkey-users@mail.freesoftware.fsf.org </a> Mailing-list, where you can 
either contact the developpers or ask other users for advises.
  <li> The 
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=mldonkey"> Bug Report 
system </a>
 to report bugs appearing when running mldonkey.
  <li> The
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?group=mldonkey"> 
Support system </a> where you can ask for support in running mldonkey.
</ul>

<p> You can also try to read/post in the 
<a href="http://www.mldonkeyworld.com/">
 MLDonkey Forums </a> or on the IRC Channel #mldonkey on irc.freenode.net .

  <li> <h3> <a name=back4>   Where can I download mldonkey ?  </a> </h3>

The latest stable binaries can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/mldonkey/">
 Project Download page </a>.

If you want a more recent version of mldonkey, you need to check out the 
sources from the CVS, and compile it yourself. 
See <a href=#index_build> Building Mldonkey </a> for help.

<li> <h3> <a name=back5> Where can I find mldonkey for Windows ?  </a> </h3>

MLdonkey does not run very well under Cygwin on Windows. Moreover, there 
is no native port of MLdonkey to Windows, so you will not be able to run 
it on these systems.

     <p>

     If you have some knowledge of MinGW, you might try to compile
     Objective-Caml and mldonkey. It would probably run better than under
     Cygwin. Note that mldonkey does not use threads, and the select call
     is only used to descriminate between sockets (read/write/connect/accept).

<li> <h3> <a name=back6> What's new with MLdonkey 2.00 ? </a> </h3>

     If you were using MLdonkey 1.16, you might be interested in knowing what is new
     with MLdonkey 2.00. Here are the main improvements:

     <ul>

       <li> Overnet support.
       <li> Completely New GUI: upload panel, icons, configuration of many options.
       <li> Post-filtering of results (see Overnet or LimeWire plugins).
       <li> Multi-networks support (sources and CVS only).
       <li> Many bug fixes: memory leak, "too many open file descrs", sharing,
	    upload/download rates, ...
     </ul>
     
</ol>

<hr>
<li> <h2> Running mldonkey </H2>

<ol>

<li> <H3> <a name=run1> How should I start mldonkey ? </a> </H3>

mldonkey will install its configuration files in the directory where you 
start it. So, first, choose the right directory, where you want it to run.
Then, copy the "servers.ini" file that is in the distribution in this 
directory. I suppose here that mldonkey is started in its directory.

Start mldonkey with:

<pre>
./mldonkey
</pre>

It should display some debug info. DON'T CLOSE THE TERMINAL WHERE IT
WAS STARTED, otherwise it might get blocked on terminal output.

 Once you are sure it works correctly, you can dump the debug info in a file
(but it can become very big) or better in /dev/null, the next time you 
start it:

<pre>
./mldonkey &> /dev/null
</pre>

<li> <h3> <a name=run2> How can I control mldonkey ? </a> </h3>

 You have three different ways to control the mldonkey daemon (note that, by
default, mldonkey is configured to accept only control connections from the
host running mldonkey (<a href=#gui2> more info </a>)):

<ul>

<li> The telnet interface: the telnet interface allows you to control 
mldonkey locally or remotely from a terminal with simple commands:
<pre>
telnet localhost 4000
</pre>
where <tt> localhost </tt> is the host running mldonkey and 4000 is the 
default port for the telnet interface.

<p>
There are many commands available. Use the <tt> help </tt> command to 
display all of them.

<li> The WEB interface: the WEB interface allows you to control mldonkey 
through your favorite navigator. The default url is:

<pre>
http://localhost:4080/
</pre>

where  <tt> localhost </tt> is the host running mldonkey and 4080 is the 
default port for the WEB interface.

<li> The GTK GUI: you can use a powerful GTK interface to control mldonkey.
It is called <tt> mldonkey_gui </tt>. Use the File::Setting menu to 
configure how to connect to your mldonkey daemon.


</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=run3> Where/what are mldonkey configuration files ? </a> </h3>

MLdonkey creates its configuration files in the directory where it is 
started. All of them terminate with a .ini extension. You should not 
modify them while mldonkey is running since it periodically overwrites 
them. Instead you should either stop it, or modify the options using one of 
the interfaces.

<ul>

<li> <tt> downloads.ini </tt> : the basic options (and historically, the 
edonkey plugin options)
<li> <tt> files.ini </tt> : the list of files being currently downloaded, 
and informations needed to recover the download after a stop.
<li> <tt> servers.ini </tt> : the list of all known servers for all networks.
<li> <tt> friends.ini </tt> : the list of your friends (peers you like to 
browse files) on all networks.

<li> Other configuration files are used by mldonkey plugins, normally one 
per network.

<li> <tt> ~/.mldonkey_gui.ini </tt> : the GUI configuration file is the 
only one which is not stored in the mldonkey directory.

</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=run4> How can I control the bandwidth used by mldonkey ? </a> </H3>

There are two options in the downloads.ini file: max_hard_upload_rate and
max_hard_download_rate. Setting these options to 0 means that there are no 
limits. They are expressed in kilobytes/second (not kilobits/second !).
The upload limit both applies to the files which are downloaded from you, 
and for the messages you send to ask for files: be careful not to limit 
your upload too much !

<p>

</table>

<li> <h3> <a name=run5> When I modify an option in the config file, mldonkey overwrites it
with its old value ? </a> </h3>

There are two cases:
<ul>
 <li> When you edit a config file, mldonkey must not run. Indeed, mldonkey
saves its configuration periodically, overwritting any changes made in the
files.
 <li> Be careful with the syntax. If mldonkey can't parse the config file, it
will generate a new file with the old values for all options that couldn't 
be read correctly. You must remember that you must put filenames and directory
names between "" (they are not always required if there are no special 
characters inside the name (such as spaces, slashes, etc...), so mldonkey can 
remove them in some cases).
 
</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=run6> Where are the files I have downloaded with 
mldonkey  ? </a> </h3>

Files being currently downloaded are temporarily stored in the <tt> 
temp/ </tt> directory at the level of mldonkey config files. Files in this 
directory are identified by their MD4 (for edonkey files) or by a random 
identifier. 

<p> When the download of a  file is finished, the file is added to a list 
of files that have to be "committed". These files are not renamed, so they
are still kept in the temp directory.

 <p> To move finished downloads into the <tt> incoming/ </tt> directory with
their final name, you need to use the command <tt> commit </tt> in the
telnet, or the "Save" buttons in the GUI.

<li> <h3> <a name=run7> Why does MLdonkey automatically pause some of my downloads ? </a> </h3>

 When mldonkey receives data for a file from the network, it tries to write
this data in the file in the temp/ directory. If, for some reason, it cannot
write the data, it immediatly pauses the file.

<p> This can happen for different reasons:

<ul>
  <li> You have no space left on the disk. You can verify it with the "df" 
    command, and free some space for the downloads to continue.
  <li> The user running mldonkey has not write permissions to write in
    your temp/ directory, or on the file temporary file.
</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=run8> How can I reach mldonkey WEB interface 
if my firewall only allows port 80 ? </a> </h3> 

If you want to access the WEB interface (port 4080) through a firewall,
and the firewall only allows port 80, and you don't want to run mldonkey 
as root, you can set up the apache WEB server to redirect requests to mldonkey:

<ul>
 <li> Edit your "httpd.conf" : Insert the following lines somewhere in the 
"Section 2: main server configuration":

<pre>
RewriteEngine       on
ProxyRequests        on
RewriteRule /mldonkey http://localhost:4080/$1 [P,L]
RewriteRule /(submit.*) http://localhost:4080/$1 [P,L]
RewriteRule /(files.*) http://localhost:4080/$1 [P,L]
ProxyPassReverse /(.*)  http://localhost:4080/$1
</pre>

where, of course, <tt> localhost </tt> is your mldonkey host, and <tt> 
4080 </tt> is the <tt> http_port </tt> of mldonkey.

<li> With these rules, <tt> http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/mldonkey </tt>,
where <tt>aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd</tt> is the IP address of the host running the 
apache server, should connect to your mldonkey.

</ul> 

</ol>

<hr>
<li> <h2> Running the GTK GUI </h2>

<ol>

<li> <H3> <a name=gui1> When I start the GUI, I get a lot of error messages, 
and the GUI terminates with a "Segmentation Fault" ? </a> </H3>

You probably use the "static" binary of mldonkey GUI. Download the 
"shared" binaries from this site, and use that GUI. This bug is caused by 
an incompatibility between the statically linked GTK library and the 
themes installed on your distribution.

<li> <H3> <a name=gui2> I can't connect to mldonkey from a remote host, 
neither by telnet, WWW or the GUI ? </a> </H3>

You need to modify the "allowed_ips" option in the downloads.ini file to 
define which hosts are allowed to control your mldonkey core.

You can either stop mldonkey, and edit the downloads.ini file:

<pre>
allowed_ips = ["127.0.0.1"; "192.168.255.255"; "65.64.43.63"]
</pre>

for example allows your localhost (127.0.0.1) to control mldonkey, all the 
hosts from the network 192.168.*.*, and the host 65.64.43.63.

If you don't want to stop mldonkey, just connect locally with the telnet, 
and type:

<pre>
set allowed_ips "127.0.0.1 192.168.255.255 65.64.43.63"
</pre>

<li> <h3> <a name=gui3> The GUI is immediatly disconnected from the core, or keeps connecting and disconnecting very fast  ? </a> </h3>

There are two cases to consider:

<ul>

<li> You have set a password in the core to access it through the GUI: you 
must enter the password in the GUI too (use the <tt> Files :: Settings 
</tt> menu for that.

 <li> You have two GUIs connected to the same core: the core (1.99 and
later) only allows one GUI to be connected simultaneously. When you connect,
it immediatly disconnects the previous GUI. This can only work if the
previous GUI does not try to reconnect automatically: <tt> mldonkey_gui </tt>
will not reconnect, but maybe you are using another contributed GUI, which
tries to automatically reconnect, and make the core disconnect your GUI ?
Then, tell its author to remove this feature or to put an option to disable
it.

</ul>

<li> <h2> Building mldonkey </h2>

<ol>
  <li> <h3> <a name=build1>   How can I download the latest sources 
of mldonkey ? </a> </h3>

 Checkout the sources of mldonkey from the 
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group_id=1409"> CVS repository </a>.
Here is the standard procedure:

<!--
or download the 
<a href="http://freesoftware.fsf.org/cvs.backups/mldonkey.tar.gz">
CVS tarball
</a> (be careful, .
-->

<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/mldonkey login
(password: just hit enter)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/mldonkey co mldonkey
</pre>


  <li> <h3> <a name=build2> What do I need to compile mldonkey on my system ? </a> </h3>

 You need ocaml-3.06 (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html">
Ocaml site </a>) installed
     for the code
     and        <a href="http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html"> 
lablgtk </a> compiled in native code with ocaml 3.06 for the GTK gui.

The easiest way is to download binaries for your system. Otherwise, use 
the following lines to install them:

<ul>
 <li> Installing Objective-Caml 3.06 in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>

<pre>
    ~/tmp> tar zxf ocaml-3.06.tar.gz
    ~/tmp> cd ocaml-3.06
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.06> ./configure
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.06> make world opt opt.opt
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.06> make install
</pre>

<li> LablGTK 1.2.3 for example

<pre>
    ~/tmp> tar zxf lablgtk-1.2.3.tar.gz
    ~/tmp> cd lablgtk-1.2.3
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make configure
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make opt
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make install
</pre>

Do not forget the "make opt" which is required to get a native-code version
of the libraries.

</ul>

  <li> <h3> <a name=build3> How do I compile mldonkey on my system ? </a> </h3>


  To compile the core, you just need to use the following commands:
       <pre>
       cd mldonkey
       ./configure [...options...]
       make depend
       make
       </pre>

       You should now have a "mldonkey" executable ... No "make install" is
     provided.
       
<p> If you get strange errors from make, you probably need to use "gmake" 
on your system.

       <p>
       You can use the following options for the configure:
<ul>
<li>  --enable-batch : install Objective-Caml and Lablgtk locally just 
to be able to compile mldonkey.
<li> --disable-multinet:       allows you to only compile support for edonkey
<li> --disable-audiogalaxy:       allows you to remove support for Audio Galaxy
<li> --disable-opennap:       allows you to remove support for Open Napster
<li> --disable-limewire:       allows you to remove support for LimeWire
<li> --disable-directconnect:       allows you to remove support for Direct Connect
<li> --disable-soulseek:       allows you to remove support for SoulSeek
<li> --disable-openft:       allows you to remove support for OpenFT
<li> --disable-donkey:       allows you to remove support for eDonkey
</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=build4> I just updated from CVS, and I get an error while compiling ? </a> </h3>

  After an update from the CVS, you MUST restart the configure script, and 
rebuild the dependencies:

       <pre>
       cd mldonkey
       cvs login
       cvs -z3 up -d
       ./configure [...options...]
       make depend
       make
       </pre>

  If the error messages are related to camlzip, a workaround is to edit 
manually the file <tt> config/Makefile.config </tt>, and to change the line
<tt> ZLIB=no </tt> and <tt> SOULSEEK=no </tt> (only soulseek requires 
camlzip).

</ol>

<li> <h2> The eDonkey plugin </h2>

<ol>

<li> <H3> <a name=edonkey0>  What is the eDonkey network ? </a> </H3>

  The <a href="http://www.edonkey2000.com"> eDonkey network </a> is a network 
specialized in sharing really big files (between 0 to 1.4 GB).

<p>
This network offers a set of characteristics that cannot be found on other networks:
<ul>
  <li> Files can be downloaded from different sources at the same time.
  <li> Files are identified by uniq identifiers (MD4) that can be used to find
     new sources for a file.
  <li> Files are checked using checksums, and chunks (9MB) that are corrupted 
     are downloaded again.
  <li> Files chunks can be downloaded in any order.
  <li> Files are shared as soon as a checked chunk has been downloaded, to
     speed up the spreading of files.
</ul>

<li> <H3> <a name=edonkey1>  Why can't  mldonkey connect to any server ? </a> </H3>

<ul>
 <li> First, check that you have some servers known by mldonkey: connect 
to mldonkey by telnet (telnet localhost 4000) and use the "vma" command to
display all known servers.
 <li> If you have no servers known, you need to add a list of servers for 
mldonkey to connect to them: you can either:
  <ul>
    <li> Manually add them in the telnet :)
    <li> Import a Windows server.met file (downloaded on the WEB):
 use the "servers" command in the telnet, for example:

<pre>
servers "/mnt/windows/bureau/edonkey server list/server.met"
</pre>

    <li> You can restart mldonkey after copying the "servers.ini" file that
was in the distribution.
  </ul>
 <li> If you already have a list of known servers, maybe the list is not 
up-to-date, and maybe the servers are full. Try to add some new servers 
like above.
</ul>

<li> <h3> <a name=edonkey2> How can I import my old edonkey files under mldonkey ? </a> </h3>

<ul>
 <li>   Use the <tt>import</tt> command with the donkey directory containing your old
config as parameter. If your old edonkey was running on 
<tt> /home/bidule/edonkey </tt> (mldonkey should find a "pref.met" file in 
this directory), you can send the following command on mldonkey console:

<pre>
import "/home/bidule/edonkey"
</pre>

 <li> This might not work for a Windows configuration, since the absolute
path under windows is not the same as under linux (different mount points).
In this case, retry this command, but before, make sure that:

<ul>
 <li> The files you want to import are in a "temp" directory, inside the 
directory you give to the "import" command.
 <li> Remove the "pref.met" file, so that mldonkey does not try to use the 
temp directory specified in this file.
</ul> 

</ul>

 <li> <h3> <a name=edonkey3> Where can I find files on eDonkey without searching on servers ? </a> </h3>

  There are two kinds of WEB sites where you can find <a href=#edonkey4> 
ed2k:// links </a> for files on eDonkey:

<ul>
  <li> Recommandation Engines: on these Web sites, you will find commented 
     files, that you are sure to find complete on the eDonkey network. 

<ul>
  <li> The most famous is <a href="http://www.sharereactor.com"> Share 
Reactor </a>
</ul>

  <li> Search Engines: these Web sites allow you to search for files 
that are currently available on some servers. However, you have no 
guaranty they are complete:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.filedonkey.com"> File Donkey </a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.jigle.com"> Jigle </a>
</ul>
</ul>

      <li> <h3> <a name=edonkey4> Why does mldonkey only connect 5 
servers, whereas <tt> max_connected_servers </tt> is greater ? </a> </h3>

Being connected to several servers can be useful to spread the files you 
are uploading, and to initially find more sources to begin a download. 

<p> However, each server on which you are connected is not available for 
another user. For this reason, you should not stay connected to too many 
servers. mldonkey enforces this policy by limiting to 5 the number of 
servers on which you remain connected for a long time, whatever the value 
of <tt> max_connected_servers </tt> is.

<p> Thus, you should simply see <tt> max_connected_servers </tt> as the 
number of servers mldonkey tries to connect concurrently to at the 
startup, not as the number of servers he will remain connected to.

<li> <h3> <a name=edonkey5> What's about Overnet ? </a> </h3> 

     <a href="http://www.overnet.com"> Overnet </a>  is a network using the same
     download protocol as edonkey, but a different
     <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/529075.html"> search/localisation protocol </a>,
     that doesn't need servers.

     <p>

     MLdonkey 2.00 is able to search for files and sources on Overnet. For that, you must
     make sure that:

     <ol>

       <li> The "overnet_search_sources" and "overnet_search_keywords" options are set to
	    true.

       <li> You have a (recent) list of Overnet peers that you can connect to. For that, you
	    can:

	    <ul>
	      <li> Use the "servers.ini" file from the most recent distribution of mldonkey. It
		   contains a long list of Overnet peers.

	      <li> Use the "boot IP PORT" command, to add a new peer.

	      <li> Use the "ovweb URL" command, to download a .ocl file from url URL
		   containing a list of recent peers.
		   
	    </ul>

	    You can use the "ovstats" command, to display how many peers you have been able
	    to connect to (well, they have replied to a connect UDP packet).

       <li> If you have enabled "overnet_search_keywords", replies to search can arrive from
	    Overnet peers. These results are not very accurate (they only need to match only
	    one of the keywords, instead of all for example).

	    <p>

	    As for all networks, you can activate post-filtering of results (very useful on
	    Gnutella too): set the "filter_search" option to true, and maybe the "filter_search_delay"
	    option (period between results updates in seconds). Then, only results matching exactly
	    your query will be displayed.
	    
     </ol>
     
 <li> <h3> <a name=edonkey6> I'm behind a firewall, what should I do ? </a> </h3> 

MLdonkey uses two ports for incoming connections, one on TCP (default is 
4662) and the other one for UDP (4666). Thus, you should open these ports
in your firewall, and forward them to the computer running mldonkey. More 
generally, you can do that for all ports between 4660 and 4670.

<p> Allowing incoming connections is important as it is the only way for 
you to connect other sources which are behind a firewall.

<p> If you have no control on the firewall, and your administrator blocks 
port 4660 to 4670, you should change the port used by mldonkey in the configuration
file <tt> downloads.ini </tt> : <tt> port </tt> is the TCP port, while the 
UDP port is always computed as <tt> port + 4 </tt>.

<li> <h3> <a name=edonkey7> How can I share multiple directories ? </a> </h3> 

Just edit the <tt> shared_directories </tt> option in <tt> downloads.ini </tt>:

<pre>
shared_directories = [ "/usr/share/documents"; "/usr/share/videos"]
</pre>

</ol>

<li> <h2> The Soulseek plugin </h2>

<ol>

<li> <H3> <a name=slsk0> What is the Soulseek network ? </a> </H3>

The <a href="http://www.soulseek.org"> Soulseek Network </a> is a network 
similar to Napster.

 <p> You connect on a single server, and there, you can search for (mainly
audio) files, you can join rooms to chat with other users, and you can browse
other users files.

<li> <H3> <a name=slsk1> Why can't mldonkey connect to any server ? </a> </H3>

There is only one server on Soulseek, and the one you have in soulseek.ini 
is probably not up-to-date. Normally, mldonkey will download another one, so
that you will have to servers in your list of servers.

<p>
By default, mldonkey_gui does not display the servers you are not 
connected to. So you have to use the "Display All Servers" button, and ask 
mldonkey to try to connect to the second soulseek server.

<p>
Currently, the server is <tt> mail.slsk.org </tt>, port 2242.

<p> 
Mldonkey behavior will be improved to automatically connect to the current
 server from the soulseek site Web page.

</ol>

<li> <h2> The LimeWire plugin </h2>

<ol>

  <li> <h3> <a name=limewire0> What is the LimeWire network ? </a> </h3>

  The <a href="http://www.limewire.org"> LimeWire network </a> is a 
network built upon the <a href="http://www.gnutella.org"> Gnutella network </a>.

<p>
The main difference is that all nodes in this network do not broadcast each 
received message to its neighbours. Instead, special nodes, called 
ultra-peers, with higher connectivity are dedicated for this task, whereas 
other smaller nodes (such as mldonkey) only connect and ask ultra-peers.

<p>
Currently, the LimeWire support in MLdonkey also allows mldonkey client to 
use <a href="http://www.gnucleus.org"> Gnucleus </a>, 
<a href="http://www.morpheus.com"> Morpheus </a>, and MyNapster 
ultra-peers as servers.

<p> 
On this network, you can mainly search for small files, you have no way to 
chat nor browse other peers.

  <li> <h3> <a name=limewire1> When I search for files, I receive unrelated results ? </a> </h3>

On Gnutella, there is no specified protocol for asking complex queries to 
other peers. Instead, each peer is free to interpret your query as it 
wants and reply what it wants.

<p>
In particular, multiple-words queries are often understood as logical-or 
queries between words, ie each document that contains at least one word is returned.

<p>
       As for Overnet, you can activate post-filtering of sources. Then, results
       which are received are checked by mldonkey against the query and only displayed if
       they are accurate. Post-Filtering is activated by setting the "filter_search" option
       to true, and modifying the "filter_search_delay" depending on the period you
       want between updates (for example, 30 means that results will be added only every
       30 seconds).
