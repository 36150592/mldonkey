Maybe you need some help to understand the code ?

  1) Learn Objective-Caml (you won't be disappointed):
  
        http://ocaml.inria.fr/

  2) mldonkey directory tree:

Special directories:

config/		contains the autoconf configure.in script and other files
distrib/		files distributed with binaries in a release
patches/		patches to external programs (e.g. ocaml)
scripts/		nothing interesting here ...
tools/		useful tools to compile mldonkey (e.g. pa_zog.cma)

Useful general libraries:

cdk/		these two directories contain general modules and
lib/		data structures. diff is from history

net/		socket manipulation library around a select call (mldonkey
		is fortunately not multi-threaded, that's why it works)

chat/		part of the mlchat program inside mldonkey:

mp3tagui/	mp3 manipulation library

Program header:

common/		basic types and data structures common to all
		p2p systems.

Peer-to-peer modules (not necessary):

audio_galaxy/	Audio-Galaxy (not useful anymore)
direct_connect/	Direct-Connect (must work on that)
limewire/	LimeWire (Gnutella client)
opennap/		Open-Napster

secret/		you should not have that :) the protocol must remain
		hidden (too many discussions about that)
donkey/		the client part of donkey
server/		the server part of donkey

Program end (main):

driver/		communication with interfaces and main loop

Graphical interface:

configwin/	configuration windows for lablgtk
