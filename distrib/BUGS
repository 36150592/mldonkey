Guys, we have to feel this file with the info from the bug tracking system...

[Bug #419] mldonkey_gui core dumps with segmentation fault
 WONT FIX

  This bug appears only when running the statically-compiled GUI. Use
   the shared version instead on your system.

[Bug #420] Wrong permission on imported files
 FIXED 2002/09/18
 
  Imported files permission should be changed to 644.

[Bug #421] Web interface message "The process for http://... protocol died unexpectedly"
 FIXED (see #591)

  Probably due to a bad detection of the IP address of the client. Need to
    check the client_ip address in the config file. The URL put in the
    page Refresh field is probably incorrect.

[Bug #432] Bandwidth waste?: same packet is send with the same data 
 FIXED 2002/09/16

  The same packet was sent to the same host many times. In fact, to the
   head of (udp_servers_list) instead of the head of (list) in
   donkeyFiles.ml

[ Bug #492 ] Potential security problem - mldonkey creating subdirectories.
 FIXED

  The use of safe_mkdir could create directories for filename containing /.
  A better approach would be to remove bad characters in filenames.


[ Bug #512 ] get wrong result by using command "id"
 WONT FIX

  The "id" command returns the address of the router/firewall. It is ok.

[ Bug #531 ] Can't import old edonkey configuration
 INVALID

  Not enough information.

[ Bug #560 ] Filenames changed after comitting
 FIXED

[ Bug #566 ] Can´t control mldonkey via http from outside
 INVALID

  Check the allowed_ips option in downloads.ini

[ Bug #591 ] minor bug - vd: meta refresh use external ip
  FIXED 2002/09/18

  How to detect the IP address the request should be sent to ?

[ Bug #599 ] Telnet interface: vma command does not always report #user and #file
  TODO

  The stats displayed by vm and vma are those stored in the server.met file,
   and not the current ones, as found by mldonkey. The state of the GUI might
   also be out-of-date, whereas the telnet is always exact.


[ Bug #600 ] Command "extend search" does not seem to work
  INVALID

   Not enough information on the version where it appears.

[ Bug #602 ] Memory Leak on OS X
  TODO

> When I first run MLdonkey my inactive memory is about 50MB and my free
> memory about 600MB. Efter running MLdonkey for some hours (without any other
> programs besides IE)my inactive memory has grown to about 600MB - it is not
> released either when I quit MLdonkey

  Maybe the Mac OS X Ocaml GC uses mmap and locks the memory. Weird.

[ Bug #736 ] happens now-and-then
  INVALID

    Not enough information

[ Bug #747 ] File gets smaller?
  TODO

    The question is: what happens if a file has not the same size as
   expected on the network (ie you are downloading a 100 bytes file, and
   it is in fact a 200 bytes file). 
    Another question is: is the md4 always removed when a download is 
   cancelled ?

 
[ Bug #779 ] Why can't we no longer get a tarball of the cvs?
  WONT FIX

  Do not depend on me :) Normally, you can still access them on:
   http://freesoftware.fsf.org/cvs.backups/

[ Bug #782 ] ppp-connection  gets laggy
  INVALID

Use the bandwidth control options to prevent mldonkey from killing your line.

[ Bug #792 ] mldondey uses rename() for downloaded files
  FIXED

[ Bug #842 ] mldonkey overwrites the modified download.ini
  FIXED 2002/09/18

    Prevent mldonkey from that when there is a syntax error in the
   downloads.ini file.

[ Bug #843 ] No error message appears when using "servers" command and no 
  such a file is found/available
  TODO

    Be more explicit with this kind of errors. idem for non-existing commands.

[ Bug #844 ] Change Request: All settings of the download.ini file should
   be availble in the Gui
  FIXED 2002/09/14

[ Bug #849 ] mlDonkey GUI LabGTK locale
  TODO
 
   How to manage LOCALE with Lablgtk ?

[ Bug #877 ] Configuration should be stored in user home
  WONT FIX

    Since it's possible to start mldonkey from any directory, it is possible
  for different users to use the same mldonkey in different directories.

[ Bug #878 ] Hidden files are shared
  FIXED 2002/09/18

    Don't share files starting with a dot.

[ Bug #949 ] mldonkey losses upload when only sharing
  TODO

    Check what happens exactlty when the connection is reset by the
     provider. 

[ Bug #970 ] Exception DownloadTypes.Already_done, but I haven't got the file
   WONT FIX

   Even if the files have different names, they have the same md4 and are the
    same file.

  TODO

[ Bug #1052 ] buffer overflow warnings when MLdonkey is reading my shared files
  FIXED 2002/09/19

  the size of the buffer for the server connection.

[ Bug #1141 ] MLDONKEY KILLS MY LINUX!
[ Bug #1222 ] OpenBSD Kernel Panic!
 WONT FIX

     A user space program run by a user cannot be responsible of a kernel 
   panic. Maybe the memory leak could explain that ?

[ Bug #1235 ] searches are not saved
  WONT FIX

    Searches are not saved, but results are, and local searches are then 
     possible.

[ Support #101301 ] 2 files download and 62MB files.ini
