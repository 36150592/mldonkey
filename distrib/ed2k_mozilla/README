Firefox MLdonkey/eMule/aMule Protocol Handler 2.0
Copyright (C) 2003 - 2007 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>

Description:
------------
This is a protocol handler for Firefox 1.5 and later (see
www.mozilla.com) that forwards some link types to a running MLdonkey
(see mldonkey.sf.net), eMule (see www.emule-project.net) or aMule
(see www.amule.org) web interface enabled client. The protocol handler
is implemented in JavaScript and should run on any platform supported
by Firefox.

Supported protocols are ed2k:, magnet: and sig2dat:. BitTorrent links
are supported as well. For eMule and aMule, only ed2k: is supported,
of course.

Please note that eMule and aMule support is still beta and has only
been tested to work with eMule versions 0.45* and 0.46a, as well as
aMule version 2.1.3, respectively. Also note that current
authentication support for both is insecure! Passwords are sent in
plain. Please send eMule specific questions to Dan Fritz.

Prerequisites:
--------------
The web interface of your Donkey client must be enabled and access for
the host, this extension should be running on, must be enabled in
order for this extension to work.

For eMule, it is advised that you set your web interface template to
default (eMule.tmpl). It may work with other templates but this has
not been tested.

Installation:
-------------
Just open the .xpi installer file in Firefox and follow the on-screen
instructions.

If you are on a UNIX derivative system (e.g. Linux, BSD, MacOS X and
the like) and like to install this extension for all users on your
system, you most likely need to start your browser as root before the
installation. It is best to shutdown the browser completely by closing
all open windows prior to restarting it as root because there may be
some startup scripts used by your version that may just open another
window instead of starting the whole browser as root.

After having installed the package, you need to set it up. Refer to
the next section on this topic. After setup, restart your browser and
everything should be in place. Supported link types will automatically
be forwarded to your Donkey when you click on them.

Configuration:
--------------
The protocol handler is GUI configurable through Firefox' Extensions
or Add-ons menu. You can go there by clicking on Tools->Extensions or
Tools->Add-ons from the main bar of pull-down menus. There, select the
MLdonkey Protocol Handler and click on Options or Preferences. A small
configuration dialog should pop up, which allows you to set all
options. The following preference options are available:

Option: Host Address
Default: localhost
Description: Hostname on which your Donkey is running

Option: Web Port
Default: 4080
Description: Port of the Donkey's web service

Option: Password
Default: (empty)
Description: Password for eMule and aMule (MLdonkey is handled
automatically by Firefox' password manager)

Option: Mode
Default: MLDonkey
Description: Type of Donkey client to communicate with

Remember to restart your browser before any of these options can take
effect!

Deinstallation:
---------------
Deinstallation of the plugin in Firefox is straight-forward. Just open
the Extensions dialog, select the plugin there and click on Uninstall.
