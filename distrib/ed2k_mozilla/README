MLdonkey ed2k Protocol Handler 1.0
Copyright (C) 2003 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>

Description:
------------
This is a protocol handler for Mozilla (see www.mozilla.org) that forwards
"ed2k://" links to a running MLdonkey (see www.nongnu.org/mldonkey) client.

The protocol handler is primarily designed to be used in a UNIX environment,
but since it is implemented in JavaScript, it should be portable to any other
platform as well.

Usage:
------
After having installed the package, you need to set it up. Refer to the next
section on this topic.

After setup, restart Mozilla and everything should be in place. You can use
"ed2k://" links now just like any other links.

Configuration:
--------------
The protocol handler is configurable through Mozilla's preferences scheme. The
preferences can be set in multiple ways, depending on your browser version.

For Mozilla 1.3 and up, the preferences are accessible by visiting the URL
"about:config" inside the browser. This opens a page containing a table of all
available preference options. Right clicking on the table opens a menu to
create, modify and reset the options.

For Mozilla versions below 1.3, you can still set the preferences by creating
a file 'user.js' in your profile directory (this is
$HOME/.mozilla/default/<profile>/ on UNIX systems) and set the options there
by adding lines of the form: user_pref("option", "value"); to it.

The following preference options are available:

Option:			Default:	Description:
-------			--------	------------
network.ed2k.server	localhost	hostname on which MLdonkey is running
network.ed2k.user	admin		login with this username
network.ed2k.pass			login with this password
network.ed2k.port	4080		port of the MLdonkey WEB service

Remember to restart Mozilla before any of these options can take effect!

Bugs:
-----
Using ShareReactor's multi-add feature doesn't work. Only the first file will
get added.
