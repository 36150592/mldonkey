KNOWN COMMENTS (from savannah and forum):
========================================
Browser: Mozilla/4.75 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.4.17 i686; Nav) On the help page, it still says you can't set uploads
under 1K. 
If a server IP along with a colon seperated port number
is specified in the Server IP box, and enter hit, then
it gets added. This would make copy/paste from a list
of servers lots easier. Saving upstats would be nice, as well as some way of
resetting it, to get a better idea of which files to
keep shared. The downloads panel is a little busy, and not good for
small screens (some people still have to use 640x480) Perhaps move the 'save files' to an incoming tab?
(which can flash when it's got files in) On the same lines, why not show the filename/details
(the one above the colour bar) in a line, with name in
one box, size in the next (perhaps with bytes/Mb
added), and the format in another, with the colour bar
as the last item in the line, taking up the whole width
of the client, with the 'connections' panel only
popping up over the right-hand-side of the screen when
a filename is double-clicked (or when show connections
is picked from the menu)
The MD4 recover might move to the incoming tab, and the
ed2k file to below the filename/colourbar line, and
automatically change when a new file is clicked,
to show the ed2k: link.
Maybe the cancel/retry-connect could move to the
connections panel? On the search results tab, it would be nice to indicate
number of results per file, to give at least an
indication of availability.

The only problem is that since I use it (.10) it eats lots of memory and cpu
resources.. this is the 'top' line, using 90.3% of the cpu and 22.5% RAM 32294 runa      14   0 86612  84M   796 R    90.3 22.5 275:55 mldonkey
