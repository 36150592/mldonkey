TODO list for client
====================

*******************
Before 2.04 :)
*******************

* Force connect to friends from time to time to see the shared-file lists.
   [ Bug #2504 ] 
* Try to display more information on where the memory is used... in the GUI ?
    with shared files ?
* Upstats doesn't work very well in GUI, More stats ?
* nu= (download = 0) mld becomes stalled
* We should be careful with remove: can a client still be in a queue for
   another file when removed ? Add a counter to the source !
* Comments propagation
* Error Not_found in udp_handler
* Add Offline status for bad connection
* Temp files could be saved with other names
* I have more clients than in the sources
* try to ensure that clients that have a pending slot are correctly
   added/removed.
* Replace network column by network icons, file state by icons too
* tty mode in telnet ?
* Sort commands for ?? like options
* Button "New Shared Directory" in upload
* Apply some pango's patches:
  * lots of obsolete parameters in "08_better_default_parameters"
  * Remove "a la mldonkey" source propagation
  * have a look at reliable_sources
* Add a "log_file" option or argument.
* Check the NaS problem in client_name
* Download chunks separately
* Why are the files suddently paused ? at least, when forcing pause, send
   a message in the log.

Core:
=====
* Different login/password for different users.
* One list of downloading files per user (downloaded common)
* One list of searches per user
* Waiting list of files to download: when a file is downloaded, take another
   one from the fifo...
* SIGSEGV in MD4Transform
* Common functions for linear uploads and downloads

Edonkey + Overnet:
==================
* More Emule packets

  OP_REASKFILEPING (0x90) (size=16)
  OP_QUEUEFULL (0x93)
  OP_REASKACK (0x91) (size=2)
  OP_FILENOTFOUND (0x92)
* MLdonkey client generates "Exceeding Block Boundaries" errors which loses
     bandwidth
* Extended search doesnot work after connect because no ping was sent.
* Option to clear the server list at restart or when a new list is received
* Cancel and Redownload doesnot work
* What happens when a shared file cannot be read ?

GUI:
====
* commonDownloads.ml: functor
* GUI: strange bug: pausing on one file pause two of them...
* In gpattern, if an item from the selection is removed, the selection is
     not updated
* Some toolbars are not correctly updated between text, text+image, image
* Add an option tab similar to the one of mldonkeywatch
* Send all the locations to the GUI with their chunks
* Hide already downloaded files
* Create ed2k links where possible

Opennap:
========
* share files

Soulseek:
=========
 + Implement more of the protocol
 + Directory download in subdir ?
 + Check that we don't download several times the file list of friends.
 + Add a button in the tab_result to add to friend a file source (gui
      protocol -> file sources)
 + Use (file_name, size) keys for files_by_key, and iter on the table on
       upload requests to find the correct file.
 + Very long messages (several Megs) for shared file lists...
 + Remove all downloads from a given user
 + Display the number of new message per room

Direct-Connects:
================
* How do you know your IP in Direct-Connect if you are behind a firewall
* Send replies to active searches
* When a download is finished, can the link be reused ?
* Don't always download from incoming peer the files list
* Reply to active search requests
* For some reason, mldc cannot talk on some servers... France AVI for example.

GUI:
====
 * Change the color of tabs when things change

limewire:
=========
* Chech the is_http_ok function: too wide ?

net/:
=====
* Socks 5 support

opennap/:
=========
 * Register files on server
 * Reply to upload requests

For 2.1:
  - What about having one result per file ?
  - Incomplete files can be automatically deleted when too old (7 days)
  - Add a "cp" function to change the temp directory without breaking
       the sparse file format (ie without increasing the size of copied files)


*********

Later:
  * Plugins.
  * Correct display of availability.
  * Popup
  * Keep (server_ip, server_port, id) for indirect connections.
  * Manager of shared files/directories.
  * Add Friends in console and WEB. 
  * Allow hostname instead of IPs in servers and friends.
  * Queue uploads per chunk.
  * Add prefered servers.
  * Save options in a modular way (each server in a file ?).
  * Recommandation for upload.
  * Download priorities (what does it mean ?).
  * Use source groups for local downloads.
  * Use a cache of data to help diffusing files.
  * Check that program exists before trying to execute.
  * Clean the clients_by_num table from clients which are not useful anymore.
  * remove locations of downloaded files.
  * check that 'cancelled' files cannot be shared also in incoming/
  * don't add sources to files already downloaded.
  * efficient management of buffers
  * background searches: 
   - search and automatically download files
 + remove unused sources (cleanly remove them at least once per hour)
 + commit page to select saved name
 + Imported files should have permission 644.[ Bug #420 ]
 
TODO list for server
====================
* Send a ping to all clients every minute
* Implement the whole protocol for TCP clients
* Implement the whole protocol for UDP clients
* Implement the protocol for UDP servers
* Implement indexation
* Implement localisation

KNOWN COMMENTS (from savannah and forum):
========================================
Browser: Mozilla/4.75 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.4.17 i686; Nav) On the help page, it still says you can't set uploads
under 1K. 
If a server IP along with a colon seperated port number
is specified in the Server IP box, and enter hit, then
it gets added. This would make copy/paste from a list
of servers lots easier. Saving upstats would be nice, as well as some way of
resetting it, to get a better idea of which files to
keep shared. The downloads panel is a little busy, and not good for
small screens (some people still have to use 640x480) Perhaps move the 'save files' to an incoming tab?
(which can flash when it's got files in) On the same lines, why not show the filename/details
(the one above the colour bar) in a line, with name in
one box, size in the next (perhaps with bytes/Mb
added), and the format in another, with the colour bar
as the last item in the line, taking up the whole width
of the client, with the 'connections' panel only
popping up over the right-hand-side of the screen when
a filename is double-clicked (or when show connections
is picked from the menu)
The MD4 recover might move to the incoming tab, and the
ed2k file to below the filename/colourbar line, and
automatically change when a new file is clicked,
to show the ed2k: link.
Maybe the cancel/retry-connect could move to the
connections panel? On the search results tab, it would be nice to indicate
number of results per file, to give at least an
indication of availability.




GENERAL: 
- What ever happened to the 'collection' files from edonkey? I would like mldonkey to have that feature, so people can share collections of entire series. 

WEB INTERFACE: 
- Display free disk space in Web Interface so that you can check remotely how much space you still have, (good if you access mldonkey with remote windows). 
- Any chance of adding a graph to the web interface to show download/upload for a set period of time? that would truley rock. 

(21:36:13) pango: b8_bavard: first bug is that our pings lack an 0xe3 byte prefix
(21:36:37) pango: b8_bavard: should be 0xe3 0x96 (4 random bytes)
(21:37:06) pango: b8_bavard: second, the pings aren't sent at the right port; They're sent at server_port instead of server_port + 4
(21:37:57) pango: b8_bavard: I also asked some informations about the "Lugdunum server ping extension"
(21:39:03) pango: b8_bavard: if the last two random bytes are 0xaa 0x55, the server should reply with a longer packet; The 4 additionnal bytes return the maximum number of users allowed on the server
(21:39:41) pango: b8_bavard: I don't know if we could have a use for that...
