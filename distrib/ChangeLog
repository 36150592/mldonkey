Pre-Release 1.99:
  Complete change of the architecture. mldonkey should now support multiple
   peer-to-peer networks. Currently, download is possible from:

    * Audiogalaxy support: works great (oups, not useful anymore :(
     1) Must set 'enable_audiogalaxy' to true in downloads.ini 
     2) Start mldonkey. It should create 'audiogal.ini'. If you don't have any
        audiogalaxy account, create an account: go on http://localhost:4081/
        (if you are running mldonkey on localhost), and create it.
     3) Stop mldonkey. Edit audiogal.ini. Set the 'login' and 'password' 
         options from your account.
     4) Restart mldonkey. Go on http://localhost:4081/ to choose files to
         download. 

   * LimeWire bridge. works great.
     1) Must set 'enable_limewire' to true in downloads.ini
     2) It should automatically connect to several ultra peers.
     - Recover downloads works

   * Open Napster support. Seems to work.
     1) Must set 'enable_opennap' to true in downloads.ini

   * Direct Connect support. Not working  yet.
     1) Must set 'enable_directconnect' to true in downloads.ini
     2) You can connect to some hubs and search for files. Download
      is not yet working, nor sharing, so that you will probably be
      kicked fast.

  IMPORTANT:
   If you want to test some of these networks, edit the downloads.ini to
   enable them. There are a lot of debugging messages (pipe to /dev/null,
   don't kill the terminal). Most telnet commmands should work, but it is
   not sure. In the GUI, use the File->Settings->GUI->Columns panel and,
   for each type of structure, add the Network column to see in which 
   network a server or a file is located.

  * Improved server implementation (enable_server option). Not working yet.
  * Started implementing freedb bridge. Not working yet.
  * replace Sys.rename with Unix2.rename (to allow cross-device moves)
  * brand new GUI : choice of columns, icons, external chat utility, support
	for custom searches. See file ~/.mldonkey_gui.ini for changing icons
	and keyboard shortcuts. Searches skeletons are defined in the
	searches.ini file in the directory where you launched the mldonkey core.


Release 1.16:
  * Compaction forced every 'compaction_delay' hours (default is 2).
  * File age computed for files smaller than one chunk. Better downloads for
      these files.
  * Servers sending extended search results are remembered, and immediatly
     asked if their files are downloaded.
  * Predicates in Indexer should work in most cases.
  * Fixed #100833: new options 'http_bind_addr', 'gui_bind_addr', 
     'telnet_bind_addr' and 'telnet_bind_addr'.
  * Started implementing 'use_tags', a program to rename mp3s from tags (and
      maybe from freedb, someone interested ?)
  * New option 'propagate_sources' to allow mldonkey to propagate sources
     to other peers. When enabled, send far fewer messages than in 1.15.
  * Fixed #100870: WEB interface can be configured through 'html_header', 
     'web_common_header' and 'vd_reload_delay'
  * GUI buffer size increased. Can be set by 'interface_buffer' in 
     ~/.mldonkey_gui.ini
  * Fixed bug making mldonkey use 100% CPU for long periods.
  * Fixed option name for 'update_server_list'
  * New options 'max_sources_per_file' to limit the number of sources for
    a given file. One source is removed each time a new source is added 
    above this number.
  * New command 'id' to display ID numbers for connected servers.
  * 'client_buffer_size' set to 500000 by default.
  * Fixed bug in ocaml patch that made open_mldonkey never finish downloads.

Release 1.15:
  * Started implementing mldonkey_s (eDonkey compatible server)
  * GUI:
    - Should fit in 640x480 screens.
    - Server can be specified by ip:port in Add Server entry.
    - Removed some non-tailrecursive functions.
  * Core acts now with all (direct) clients as a server to diffuse sources
     for files. Indirect mldonkey clients can also receive information.
  * WEB interface:
    - New option 'customized_searches' that can be used to add new
       queries in the WEB interface (see new option file searches.ini
       for examples).
    - Improved searches (work also in the GTK GUI): 
       * In the keyword/artist/title/album fields, a '-' in front of
        a word means 'without'. Words separated by
        spaces must appear in the reply. 
       * In the format field: you can specify several formats, separated by
        spaces. A '-' in front of a format means you don't want that format.
    - New options 'web_header' and 'web_header_frame' to customize the header
       displayed by the Web interface.
    - Generate correct HTML with HEAD and TITLE :)
    - Downloads can be sorted by name/percent/downloaded/size/rate.
    - Paused downloads are correctly displayed.
    - Use tables instead of spaces (for non-fixed fonts).
    - Added option 'use_html_frames'. When frames are enabled, clicking
       on a result to download will only modify the second frame.
    - Checklist of downloads and results can be activated/desactivated with
      the option 'html_checkbox_file_list'.
    - The number of days since the file was last seen complete is now displayed
  * Core:
    - New option 'file_completed_cmd' for a command which is called when 
     a file download is completed with as arguments: 
     <filename on disk> <md4> <size> <names on the edonkey networks>*
    - Started moving local indexation from mldonkey to an auxiliary program,
     controled by options 'local_index_find_cmd' and 'local_index_add_cmd'.
     See the 'Using auxiliary programs for local indexation' section in
     the help (in progress, doesn't work).
    - New command line option -client_ip that can be used to force the
     IP used by mldonkey (if you have a firewall). Be careful with
     dynamic IPs.
    - Delay between md4 computation can be set by 'compute_md4_delay' option.
     Chunks downloaded improve to reduce long md4 computations.
  * Most problems with ed2k:// links should be fixed (/ at the end, and
     spaces in the middle). MLdonkeySubmit is distributed for Konqueror users.
  * Improved implementation of indexation. Documents description are
     stored on disk. Different choices of indexation.
  * Server black list: 'bs <ip1> <ip2> ...' in console to add IPs to the
    server blacklist. Servers on this black list are eventually removed,
    and will never be added again.
  * New option 'master_server_min_users' that prevent mldonkey from remaining
     connected to a server with too few users.
  * New option 'dont_update_server_list' to disable automatic update of
     server lists.
  * Telnet interface: 
     - New command 'remove_old_servers'

     - New option 'max_source_age' (in days) to remove old sources.
     - New option 'max_clients_per_second' to prevent bursts of connections.
  * Faster computation of md4s for i486/i586/i686 Linux systems.
  * Fixed bugs:  
   - #100662: only valid server IPs are accepted.
   - Use IP returned by getsockname instead of the one from gethostbyname.
   - #100761: new option 'update_server_list' to choose whether you want 
     mldonkey to automatically add new servers to your server list.
   - Fixed bug preventing sharing of in-download files after restart.
   - Fixed bug making history.met always increase.

Release 1.14:
  * Bandwidth is now controled by the 'max_hard_download_rate' and
      'max_hard_upload_rate' options. Old rate options are obsolete.
  * All simple options can now be set by arguments on the command line (use 
     -help to show arguments).
  * Bug fixes:
    - Removed non-tailrecursive function in options.ml causing segfault when
       loading files.ini.
    - Connected clients without names in GUI should not appear anymore.
    - Remove 2 minutes timeout for queued clients.

Release 1.13:
  * Annotations on files in file 'comments.met'. Commands 'comments <filename>'
    to load a file, and 'comment <md4> <comment>' to add a new comment.

  * New option 'web_infos' and new command 'add_url' on console: allow
    to download a file from the WEB automatically everyday (or less 
    frequently). Currently, only server.met and comments.met files are
    supported.

      - New command 'close_fds' to close all open files, to free space on disk 
        after remove.
      - New command 'pause' and 'resume' to pause and resume downloads (use
         arg 'all' to apply to all files).
  * Some control on how many connections can be opened per minute.
  * Better scheduling of compaction (new option 'compaction_overhead')
     in both core and GUI that caused delay when exiting.
