The release mechanism was changed in a way that minor updates like
this one will not get a release tag in CVS, also the version
number reported by MLDonkey will stay the same.

All numbers mentioned here can be found as patches on

4316: Updated ./distrib/Install.txt for Ocaml 3.08.4 and new GUI options
4292: html_mods: Match styles default frameHeight with the common default

4305: buildinfo: Print some system internals
4304: EDK: Fix disconnect state with verbosity = "hid"
4297: Create ini file backups on shutdown
Note: file_sources.ini is never saved, it makes no sense to keep this file.

New options:

* backup_options_format, default "tar.gz", "zip" can also be used

* backup_options_delay, default 0
How often (in hours) should a backup of the ini files be written into old_config.
A value of zero means that a backup is written only when the core shuts down.

* backup_options_generations, default 10
Define the total number of options archives in old_config.

Command save got two new parameters:
* "save all" saves options, sources and creates a ini file backup
* "save backup" speaks for itself;-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2005/08/11: spiralvoice (version 2.6.2 = tag release-2-6-2)

4296: BT: Fix options parsing
---------------------------------------------------------------------

4155: Let MLDonkey create its data in $HOME/.mldonkey

Usage instructions:
* if the core is started in a directory where downloads.ini exists
  this directory will be used, this is the same behaviour as before
* on Windows the current directory will always be used,
  this is consistent with eMule
* on other systems $HOME/.mldonkey will be created and used,
  this is consistent with eDonkey, aMule and Unix standards
* if variable MLDONKEY_DIR is used that directory has priority,
  to simulate the behaviour without this patch use:
    export MLDONKEY_DIR="." && ./mlnet

* new command rm_old_torrents: delete all files in torrents/old
* eDonkey like statistics for BT clients (csbt command)
