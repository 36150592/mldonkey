Compiling mldonkey:
-------------------

1) Installing required tools: Objective-Caml 3.05 and LablGTK 1.2.3

 1.1) Objective-Caml 3.05 (from   http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml)

  You don't need to patch it anymore for eDonkey support. It is done while
  compiling mldonkey. If you still want to patch it, the patch is in
  mldonkey/patches/ocaml-3.05.patch.

    ~/tmp> tar zxf ocaml-3.05.tar.gz
    ~/tmp> cd ocaml-3.05

   If you REALLY want to patch it:
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.05> patch -p1 < ~/tmp/mldonkey/patches/ocaml-3.05.patch

    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.05> ./configure
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.05> make world opt opt.opt
    ~/tmp/ocaml-3.05> make install

 1.2) LablGTK 1.2.3 (from 
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html)

    ~/tmp> tar zxf lablgtk-1.2.3.tar.gz
    ~/tmp> cd lablgtk-1.2.3
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make configure
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make opt
    ~/tmp/lablgtk-1.2.3> make install

2) Compiling mldonkey:

    ~/tmp/mldonkey> ./configure
    ~/tmp/mldonkey> make depend
    ~/tmp/mldonkey> make byte
    ~/tmp/mldonkey> make opt

  You should now have 'mldonkey' (the daemon), 'mldonkey_gui' (the interface)
 and 'mlchat' (a chat program). No 'make install' is provided.

  You can disable all other p2p networks using the --disable-multinet option
   with ./configure. Only edonkey support will then be compiled.

See the USAGE.txt file for information on how to use mldonkey.
Note that you should execute mldonkey in the distrib/ directory, where a list
of servers is present.
